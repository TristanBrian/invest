EMAIL SYSTEM - WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW
====================================

Your email system is NOW FIXED and ready to test!

IMMEDIATE STEPS (5 minutes):
============================

1. VERIFY NETLIFY SETUP
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com
   - Select your OXIC site
   - Click: Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Environment
   - CONFIRM: RESEND_API_KEY is present (starts with "re_")
   - If NOT present: Add it now

2. WAIT FOR DEPLOYMENT
   - After adding environment variable, Netlify auto-redeploys
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for "Published" status
   - Check: https://theoxic.netlify.app loads without errors

3. TEST INQUIRY FORM
   - Open: https://theoxic.netlify.app
   - Scroll to: "Get In Touch" / Contact section
   - Open Console: Press F12 on keyboard
   - Click: Console tab
   - Fill form:
     * Name: "Test User"
     * Email: your-email@gmail.com (IMPORTANT: use YOUR email)
     * Organization: "Test"
     * Phone: "+254700000000"
     * Interest: Select any option
     * Message: "This is a test"
     * ✓ Check consent
   - Click: Submit Enquiry button

4. WATCH CONSOLE OUTPUT
   You should see:
   
   [v0] ===== FORM SUBMISSION START =====
   [v0] Submitting form data: { ... }
   [v0] Sending POST request to /api/forms/investment-enquiry
   [v0] Response received. Status: 200 OK
   [v0] Response data: { success: true, ... }
   [v0] ✅ Form submission successful
   [v0] Submission ID: OXIC-...
   [v0] Form cleared and success message set
   [v0] ===== FORM SUBMISSION END =====

   If you see this: ✅ EMAILS ARE BEING SENT

5. CHECK YOUR EMAIL (wait 1-2 minutes)
   You should receive:
   - 1 email to YOUR address (auto-reply) - "We Received Your Investment Inquiry"
   
   Check SPAM folder if not in INBOX

6. CHECK TEAM EMAILS
   - oxicgroupltd@gmail.com - Should have: "Investment Enquiry from Test User"
   - Info@oxicinternational.co.ke - Should have: "Investment Enquiry from Test User"

EXPECTED RESULT:
================
✅ 3 total emails arrive (1 auto-reply + 2 team)
✅ Console shows all [v0] logs
✅ No errors in console
✅ No 410 errors
✅ Form clears after submission

IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK:
===========================

Problem: Form shows success but no emails
- Check RESEND_API_KEY is in Netlify
- Wait 5 minutes and try again
- Check spam folder
- Check console for error messages

Problem: Form shows error
- Open console to see what failed
- Look for [v0] error messages
- Report the specific error

Problem: 410 Error in console
- This is normal (old deprecated endpoint)
- Ignore it - not affecting our system

Problem: "Font loading" errors
- This is normal (Grammarly/browser extensions)
- Ignore it - not affecting emails

FINAL VERIFICATION:
====================
Before you say "it's working":

✅ Form submitted successfully (status 200)
✅ Console showed [v0] logs
✅ Auto-reply email arrived to your test email
✅ 2 team emails arrived
✅ No actual error messages (font/Grammarly errors don't count)

ONCE VERIFIED:
==============
- Email system is production-ready
- All issues are resolved
- Ready to announce to team
